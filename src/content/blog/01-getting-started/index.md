After more than two years at Pinhome, my journey with the company has come to an end. This is the first time I’ve ever been laid off—and honestly, it still feels surreal to even write those words.

It wasn’t something I expected.
It wasn’t something I was prepared for.
And like many others in similar situations, my first reaction was a mix of shock, fear, and confusion.

I kept thinking:
"What did I do wrong?"
"Will I be able to find something soon?"
"What now?"

The Emotional Whirlwind
No one really talks about the emotional side of being laid off until it happens to you. It hits hard—not just professionally, but personally too. You question your worth, your contributions, and your future. The routines you’ve built, the people you work with, and the goals you’ve chased suddenly disappear.

And that’s okay. It's okay to feel lost for a bit.
But it’s also important to realize: being laid off is not a personal failure.

Companies make tough decisions, and sometimes those decisions affect even the most hardworking, dedicated people. You can be doing great work and still be impacted. That doesn’t erase your value.

What I’ve Learned (So Far)
As I take some time to reflect, here are a few things I’ve learned—and that I hope might help others too:

1. Your job is not your identity.
It’s easy to tie your self-worth to your job title, your company, or the projects you've led. But who you are is so much more than where you work. Your skills, values, and experiences stay with you, even after the job ends.

2. It's okay to slow down.
The instinct is to immediately jump into job searching—but sometimes, you need to pause first. Let the emotions settle. Reconnect with what you want, not just what’s available. Clarity takes time, and that’s okay.

3. Build and lean on your network.
Reach out. Let people know you’re looking. Most people want to help, and many have gone through similar experiences. Conversations—even casual ones—can lead to unexpected opportunities.

4. Reflect on what you really want.
A layoff, while painful, is also a rare moment to reset. What kind of work energizes you? What kind of culture do you want to be part of? What kind of impact do you want to make? These are questions worth exploring before jumping into the next thing.

5. You’re not alone.
So many incredibly talented people have gone through layoffs. It’s more common than we think. Talking about it helps. Sharing your story helps. We grow stronger by being open and supporting each other.

Looking Ahead
I’m still figuring things out. The uncertainty is real—but so is the opportunity.

I’m open to new challenges, to joining teams that care about building great things and supporting one another. I’m using this time to learn, recharge, and realign with what matters most to me professionally.

If you’ve gone through something similar or just want to connect—reach out. Whether it’s to share stories, opportunities, or support, I’d love to hear from you.

And to those currently going through a layoff:
You are not your job.
You still have so much to offer.
This is not the end—it’s just a new beginning.
