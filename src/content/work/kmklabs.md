At KMK Labs, the product and engineering arm of KMKOnline, I contributed to building and enhancing Liputan6.com and supported the early development of Vidio.com. As a Frontend Engineer, I worked in a highly collaborative environment with a strong emphasis on pair programming, closely partnering with other engineers and cross-functional teams.

My work primarily involved front-end development using jQuery, while also interfacing with backend systems built in Ruby on Rails and PHP. This role gave me valuable experience in building large-scale consumer-facing platforms and deepened my skills in both frontend and full-stack collaboration.
